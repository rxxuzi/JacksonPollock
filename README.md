# JacksonPollock

This project is a tribute to the legendary abstract expressionist painter, Jackson Pollock. 
Using a web-based canvas, users can emulate Pollock's iconic drip painting style. 

## About Jackson Pollock

Jackson Pollock (1912-1956) was an American painter and a leading figure in the abstract expressionist movement. 
He is best known for his unique style of drip painting. 
Instead of using a traditional easel, Pollock placed his canvases on the ground and poured or dripped paint from a can; he would often use hardened brushes, sticks, and even basting syringes as paint applicators.

Pollock's innovative approach to painting, combined with his perspective on nature, energy, and unconsciousness, resulted in vibrant, rhythmic, and mesmerizing artworks. His work has been influential, and he remains a stalwart figure in the art world.
